<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Electrophysiology Navigation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 3D electrophysiology navigation system market includes both contact type and non-contact type systems. Contact type systems involve the use of catheters that make direct contact with the patient's tissues to map and navigate the heart's electrical signals. These systems offer accurate real-time data but require physical contact and can be invasive. On the other hand, non-contact type systems use advanced imaging technologies like magnetic fields or ultrasound to map the heart's electrical activity without direct contact. These systems are less invasive and provide a wider field of view, but may offer slightly less accuracy compared to contact type systems.</p></p>
