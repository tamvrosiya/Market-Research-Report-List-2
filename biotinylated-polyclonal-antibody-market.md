<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biotinylated Polyclonal Antibody Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Primary Antibody</li><li>Secondary Antibody</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biotinylated polyclonal antibody market consists of two types: primary antibody and secondary antibody. Primary antibodies are raised against a specific antigen and are used to detect and bind directly to the target antigen. They are usually conjugated with biotin for detection purposes. Secondary antibodies, on the other hand, are raised against primary antibodies from a different species and are used to bind to primary antibodies, forming a sandwich complex. These secondary antibodies are conjugated with biotin to facilitate detection through additional binding of streptavidin or avidin linked to a reporter enzyme, fluorophore, or other detection moieties.</p></p>
