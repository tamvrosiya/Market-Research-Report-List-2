<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Clock Jitter Cleaners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-loop PLL</li><li>Dual PLL</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Clock jitter cleaners are devices used to reduce or eliminate the jitter (timing uncertainty) in digital clocks. The market offers different types of clock jitter cleaners. Single-loop PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) utilizes a feedback loop to constantly adjust the clock frequency and phase, minimizing jitter. Dual PLL uses two separate PLLs, one for generating a reference clock and the other for cleaning the original clock. This approach provides better performance by isolating the reference clock from the cleaned clock. Other types of clock jitter cleaners may employ different techniques, such as using digital signal processing algorithms or voltage-controlled oscillators.</p></p>
