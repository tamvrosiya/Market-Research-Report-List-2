<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cochlear Implant Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unilateral</li><li>Binaural</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cochlear implant systems are medical devices designed to provide hearing sensations to individuals with severe hearing loss or deafness. There are two types of market systems for cochlear implants - unilateral and binaural. Unilateral cochlear implant systems involve the implantation of a single device in one ear, providing hearing in one ear only. Binaural cochlear implant systems, on the other hand, involve the implantation of devices in both ears, allowing for hearing sensations in both ears. These systems aim to improve hearing ability and quality of life for those with hearing impairments.</p></p>
