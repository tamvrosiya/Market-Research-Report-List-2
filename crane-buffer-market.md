<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crane Buffer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Storage Type Buffer</li><li>Energy-Consuming Buffer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two types of crane buffers in the market: storage type buffer and energy-consuming buffer. </p><p>1. Storage Type Buffer: This type of buffer is designed to absorb and store the energy generated by a crane during its operation. It uses a hydraulic or pneumatic mechanism to absorb the impact and convert it into potential energy, which is then stored for future use. The stored energy can be released gradually, reducing the impact on the crane and preventing damage or accidents.</p><p>2. Energy-Consuming Buffer: Unlike the storage type buffer, the energy-consuming buffer dissipates the kinetic energy generated by the crane through an energy-absorbing material. When the crane comes into contact with the buffer, the material absorbs the energy and converts it into heat, reducing the impact force. This type of buffer is commonly used in applications where space limitations prevent the use of storage type buffers or where energy efficiency is a priority.</p></p>
