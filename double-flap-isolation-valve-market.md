<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Flap Isolation Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lifting</li><li>Rotary Opening</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Double flap isolation valves are a type of valve commonly used in industrial applications to control the flow of fluids. They are available in two main types - lifting and rotary opening. In lifting valves, the double flaps move in an upward direction to open the valve, allowing the fluid to pass through. On the other hand, the rotary opening valves have a rotating mechanism that turns the flaps to open or close the valve. Both types provide effective isolation and control of fluid flow in various industries.</p></p>
