<p><h1>Drug-Eluting Stent Market, Centers on Aspects such as Market Growth Market Share, Market Opportunity, and Projected Forecasts Spanning from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Drug-Eluting Stent Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>A drug-eluting stent (DES) is a small mesh tube that is used to treat blocked or narrowed arteries in the heart. It is coated with a special medication that is slowly released into the artery to prevent it from re-narrowing or re-blocking. The medication helps to reduce the risk of restenosis, which is the reoccurrence of blockage in the treated artery. </p><p>The drug-eluting stent market has shown significant growth in recent years and is expected to continue growing at a CAGR of 4.2% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to various factors, including the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, rising geriatric population, and advancements in stent technologies.</p><p>Key market trends in the drug-eluting stent market include the adoption of biodegradable stents, the development of bioresorbable polymers for drug delivery, and the introduction of bioabsorbable stents. Biodegradable stents have gained popularity as they eliminate the need for a permanent implant, reducing the risk of long-term complications. Bioresorbable polymers are being developed to enhance drug delivery and reduce long-term inflammation. Bioabsorbable stents, on the other hand, are designed to completely dissolve over time, leaving no foreign material in the artery.</p><p>Additionally, the drug-eluting stent market is witnessing advancements in materials used for stent coating, such as polymer-free coatings and nanoparticle-based coatings. These innovations aim to improve drug delivery, enhance biocompatibility, and reduce the risk of adverse events.</p><p>Overall, the drug-eluting stent market is expected to experience steady growth in the coming years, driven by the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, technological advancements, and the introduction of novel stent designs.</p></p>
