<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Industrial Cooling Tower Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cooling Tower</li><li>Closed Cooling Tower</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The dry industrial cooling tower market consists of two main types: open cooling towers and closed cooling towers. Open cooling towers are designed to use the surrounding air to cool down the hot water circulating through the tower, allowing it to evaporate and dissipate heat. Closed cooling towers, on the other hand, utilize a heat exchanger to transfer the heat from the circulating water to the surrounding air without direct contact, making them more suitable for environments where water contamination is a concern. Both types play a crucial role in cooling industrial processes and machinery.</p></p>
