<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Alarms Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Addressable Systems</li><li>Conventional</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Addressable Systems market: Addressable fire alarm systems are advanced systems that allow each device on the system to have a unique address. This enables specific identification of the location of a fire or fault within a building. Addressable systems are preferred for larger or more complex buildings as they provide detailed information for emergency responders, making it easier to locate and address the issue.</p><p>Conventional market: Conventional fire alarm systems are more basic and commonly found in small to medium-sized buildings. These systems divide the building into zones, where multiple devices are connected to each zone, making it harder to pinpoint the exact location of a fire or fault. While they are simple and cost-effective, conventional systems may not provide as much detailed information as addressable systems, making them suitable for less complex buildings.</p></p>
