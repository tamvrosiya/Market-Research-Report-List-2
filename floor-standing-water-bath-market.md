<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Floor-standing Water Bath Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Circulating Water Bath</li><li>Non-Circulating Water Bath</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The floor-standing water bath market consists of two main types: circulating water bath and non-circulating water bath. A circulating water bath is equipped with a built-in pump that continuously circulates water, ensuring uniform temperature distribution throughout the bath. It is commonly used in scientific research, pharmaceutical, and medical applications. On the other hand, a non-circulating water bath does not have a pump and relies on natural convection for temperature distribution. It is typically used for general laboratory purposes where precise temperature control is not critical.</p></p>
