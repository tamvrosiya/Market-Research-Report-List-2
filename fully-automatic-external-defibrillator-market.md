<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fully Automatic External Defibrillator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-synchronous Defibrillator</li><li>Synchronous Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A non-synchronous defibrillator is a type of fully automatic external defibrillator (AED) that delivers an electric shock to the heart without considering the patient's cardiac rhythm. It is commonly used in emergency situations where immediate action is required. On the other hand, a synchronous defibrillator is also an AED but it delivers an electric shock to the heart after analyzing the patient's cardiac rhythm in order to synchronize it with the heartbeat. This allows for a more precise and controlled delivery of the shock. Both types of AEDs are used to restore normal heart rhythm in individuals experiencing cardiac arrest.</p></p>
