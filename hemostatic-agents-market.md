<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hemostatic Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gelation Sponge</li><li>Oxidized Regenerated Cellulose Based Hemostats</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hemostatic Agents are medical substances used to control bleeding during surgical procedures or in case of an injury. Gelation sponges are made of gelatin and promote clotting by absorbing blood and facilitating its rapid coagulation. Oxidized regenerated cellulose based hemostats are derived from plant material and work by forming a gel-like barrier that aids in blood clotting. The "others" category includes a diverse range of hemostatic agents such as calcium-based compounds, fibrin sealants, and synthetic polymers that help in stopping bleeding effectively. These agents are crucial in maintaining hemostasis and preventing excessive blood loss.</p></p>
