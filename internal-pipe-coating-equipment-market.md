<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Internal Pipe Coating Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotating Pipe</li><li>Non-Rotating Pipe</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The internal pipe coating equipment market consists of two main types: rotating pipe and non-rotating pipe. Rotating pipe equipment is designed for pipes that can be rotated while applying the internal coating, typically using a spinning nozzle. This method ensures uniform coating and is commonly used in large pipes or pipelines. Non-rotating pipe equipment, on the other hand, is used for pipes that cannot be rotated or have limited rotational capabilities. This equipment generally employs a fixed nozzle system to achieve the internal coating.</p></p>
