<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lighting Contactors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrically Held</li><li>Mechanically Held</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Lighting contactors are devices used to control and operate lighting fixtures in commercial and industrial buildings. There are two main types: electrically held and mechanically held lighting contactors. </p><p>Electrically held contactors use an electric coil to hold the contacts in the closed position, allowing the flow of electricity to the lighting fixtures. When the coil is de-energized, the contacts open, turning off the lights.</p><p>In contrast, mechanically held contactors use a mechanical latch to hold the contacts closed, requiring a physical force to release them and turn off the lights. This design ensures that power to the lights is interrupted even in the case of power failure.</p></p>
