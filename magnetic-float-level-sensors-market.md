<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetic Float Level Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Type</li><li>Liquid Level Switch Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Magnetic Float Level Sensors market includes two main types: Continuous Type and Liquid Level Switch Type. Continuous Type sensors provide real-time and precise measurements of liquid levels, enabling constant monitoring and control. These sensors use a magnetic float that moves up and down with the liquid level and provides continuous readings. On the other hand, Liquid Level Switch Type sensors are used for point-level detection. They incorporate a magnetic switch that triggers an alarm or control action when a specific liquid level is reached. These sensors are commonly employed to prevent overflow or to indicate low levels in tanks or containers.</p></p>
