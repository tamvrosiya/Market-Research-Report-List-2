<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peristaltic Pumps for Municipal Water and Waste Water Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Roller Peristaltic Pump</li><li>Shoe type Peristaltic Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peristaltic pumps for municipal water and wastewater applications come in two main types: roller peristaltic pumps and shoe type peristaltic pumps. Roller peristaltic pumps use rotating rollers to compress the tube, creating a seal and moving the fluid through the system. Shoe type peristaltic pumps use a flexible shoe or hose to compress the tubing, also creating a seal and pushing the fluid along. Both types are commonly used in municipal water and wastewater treatment processes due to their gentle pumping action and ability to handle sensitive or abrasive fluids.</p></p>
