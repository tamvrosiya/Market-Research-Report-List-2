<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radio Control Servo Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cored Motor</li><li>Coreless Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Radio Control Servo market can be divided into two main types based on the type of motor used: Cored Motor and Coreless Motor. Cored Motors have a core made of iron within the motor windings, providing more power and torque, making them suitable for heavy-duty applications. On the other hand, Coreless Motors lack the iron core, resulting in smoother operation, faster response times, and lower power consumption, making them ideal for applications requiring precision and agility. Both types cater to different needs within the radio control servo market.</p></p>
