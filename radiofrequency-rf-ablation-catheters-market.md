<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiofrequency (RF) Ablation Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Irrigated</li><li>Non-irrigated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheters are medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures to treat abnormal heart rhythms. They deliver high-frequency energy to destroy or modify tissue causing the irregular rhythm. There are two types of RF ablation catheters: irrigated and non-irrigated. Irrigated catheters have small holes near the electrode tip, allowing for continuous circulation of cool saline solution to prevent overheating and create larger lesions. Non-irrigated catheters do not have these holes and rely solely on contact and power delivery to create lesions. Both types are effective in treating heart rhythm disorders, but their usage depends on the physician's preference and patient's condition.</p></p>
