<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Irrigation Controllers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Weather-based Controllers</li><li>Sensor-based Controllers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Smart irrigation controllers are advanced systems that optimize water efficiency in irrigation by using weather-based or sensor-based controls. Weather-based controllers utilize real-time weather data to adjust irrigation schedules based on factors such as rainfall, temperature, and evapotranspiration rates. This enables precise watering and prevents over or under watering. On the other hand, sensor-based controllers use moisture or soil sensors to measure the soil moisture levels and irrigate accordingly. Both types of controllers help conserve water, reduce water waste, and ensure healthier plants and landscapes.</p></p>
