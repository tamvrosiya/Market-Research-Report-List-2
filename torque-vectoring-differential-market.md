<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Torque Vectoring Differential Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Torque Vectoring Differential</li><li>Passive Torque Vectoring Differential</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Torque vectoring differential is a technology used in vehicles to enhance their handling and stability. Active torque vectoring differential actively distributes torque between the wheels to improve cornering performance and overall agility. It can vary the amount of torque sent to each wheel based on various factors such as the vehicle's speed and steering input. On the other hand, passive torque vectoring differential relies on mechanical components like limited-slip differentials to redistribute torque to the wheels. While it enhances handling to some extent, it is less versatile and responsive compared to the active torque vectoring differential system.</p></p>
