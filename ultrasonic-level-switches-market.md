<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Level Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Externally Mounted</li><li>Non Externally Mounted</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultrasonic level switches are used for detecting levels of liquid or solid substances in tanks or containers. Externally mounted switches are installed on the outside of the tank, with the ultrasonic sensor pointed towards the substance. They provide non-contact level sensing and are suitable for applications with corrosive or hazardous substances. On the other hand, non-externally mounted switches are installed directly into the tank, immersing the ultrasonic sensor into the substance. These switches are commonly used in applications where space is limited or a more compact design is required.</p></p>
